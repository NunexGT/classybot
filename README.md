A bot to greet your teachers in Google Classroom without having to wake up early.

Introduction:
Imagine the scenario where your area were affected by COVID lockdown and now you are at home and the governament decided to adapt your school to an online environemt. To make sure that during the class time you´re really wake up and stand by your computer, your teacher decides that you must greet them with a "Good Morning" or a "Good Afternoon", but that is just stupid or you just want to sleep, so here is the solution.

Introducing the ClassyBot

A bot that will open chrome, grab the most recent teacher comment it detects and then comments with a "Good Morning" or a "Good Afternoon" (Portuguese version available) so your teacher thinks you´re there and you´ll never have to wake up early again! ;)
